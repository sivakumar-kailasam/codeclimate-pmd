We love contributions! Found an issue, want a feature to be implemented, have a cool idea you want to discuss, 
raise an issue so that we discuss it and get on to implementing them via a PR.

Please take the time to look at existing issues before you raise a new one. I know its sad that GitHub hasn't 
done this already!, but it makes life simpler. You can show your interest via a +1 reaction on an existing issue.

Thanks for reading through and stay awesome!
